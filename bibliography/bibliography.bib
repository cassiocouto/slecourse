The grammar is essentially interpreted in a combinatorial sense and a number of well-defined control mechanisms help with deriving test data of the intented shape, size, and number while also avoiding combinatorial explosion. The approach has been implemented in C\# and used for grammar-based testing in the .NET platform. Combinatorial explorations constrasts with randomized test-data generation. This paper provides a broad discussion of related work.},

SugarJ provides an incremental parsing approach so that library imports can affect parsing past the import.},
