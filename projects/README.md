Some illustrative student projects as they originated from course assignments are included here. For each project, there is a short README and a LICENSE file. Those students have agreed to have their projects listed here. 

Disclaimer: these results are not considered perfect in any manner given that the students had limited time to use the relevant technologies and techniques. Thanks a lot to the students for agreeing to the publication of their efforts at SLECOURSE.
