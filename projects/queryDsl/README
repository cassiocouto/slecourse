This example illustrates the usage of converge to implement a small DSL.

The DSL is called Query and is able to perform simple queries on lists.

For an example of this dsl, refer to "query_exec.cv"

Run the code like this:

Download the binary converge distribution: http://convergepl.org/releases/2.0/

Run ~/converge-2.0/bin/converge query_exec.cv
