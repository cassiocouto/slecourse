The binary-to-decimal number conversion, as it appears in Knuth' seminal paper on attribute grammars is implemented with Prolog, Haskell, and ANTLR. The Haskell implementation is arguably the closest to the original specification by Knuth. In all examples, we use a right-recursive as opposed to a left-recursive grammar. The implementation in Prolog relies on constraints with floating point numbers because of the specific attribution, which is not S- not L-attributed. The implementation in Haskell simply exploits laziness. The implementation with ANTLR actually departs quite a bit from the original specification, which is essentially encouraged by ANTLR's limits for attribute grammars.
