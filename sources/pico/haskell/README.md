The Haskell approach is inspired by the Rascal implementation as available here:
http://tutor.rascal-mpl.org/Recipes/Languages/Pico/Load/Load.html#/Recipes/Languages/Pico/Pico.html

The following main limitations are worth reporting:
- IDE support is not provided.
- Locations are not used (in error messages).
- Comment syntax is not implemented.

Other deviations worth reporting:
- Various program identifiers are slightly changed.
- The Haskell code is not a direct counter part of the Rascal code.
