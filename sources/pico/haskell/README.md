The Haskell-based suite of language processing components for Pico is inspired by the Rascal implementation as available here: http://tutor.rascal-mpl.org/Recipes/Languages/Pico/Load/Load.html#/Recipes/Languages/Pico/Pico.html However, the Haskell code is nowhere close to a direct counter part of the Rascal code. In fact, the Haskell code doesn't cover all aspects of the Rascal code and deviates in some ways. For instance:

- IDE support is not provided.
- Locations are not used (in error messages).
- Comment syntax is not implemented.
- The analyses and visualizations are replaced by simpler use cases.
