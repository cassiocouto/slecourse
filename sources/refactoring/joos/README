Some refactorings for the JOOS language.
The code leverages the Strafunski StrategyLib.
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Strafunski-StrategyLib
The code has been tested with GHC 7.4.

JOOS is a purely object-oriented subset of Java designed by Laurie Hendren.
It is used for research experiments and education. The grammar has 24 
non-terminals and 61 productions. The abstract Haskell syntax of JOOS
was extracted from:

    David A. Watt. JOOS action semantics. Version 1, available from
    http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~daw/publications/JOOS.ps, October 1997. 

The refactorings originate from the following two papers:
