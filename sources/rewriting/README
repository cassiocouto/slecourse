These are different attempts at some sort of rewriting in Prolog.

This code is used in a lecture on rewriting and strategies.

Option "traversal":

The rewrite rules include traversal.
This is actually very similar to SOS.
Thus, the rewrite rules must find redexes by themselves.

Option "normalization":

The syntax definition also defines normalforms.
Redexes are searched top-down, left-to-right.
Rules are applied to redexes.
This process is iterated until a normalform is reached.

Option "control":

Stratego/Strafunski/et al.-like strategies are defined.
To this end, higher-order predicates are used.
